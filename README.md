### Hey o/

Welcome to my Security-focused GitHub.  You should find a few examples of my work, as well as some useful common scripts.

I'm currently focused on understanding blue-team focused skills, as well as practicing basic web application bug hunting.

My goal is to understand the most common attack vectors and how to defend against them.  Please feel free to message me for collaboration! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Python Hacking Script Library
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Zero Trust Architecture
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on SEIM tools and hotfixes
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with APT Modeling and C2C Server Deployments
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Automation
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email // Twitter
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to fix viruses through Windows XP Registry when I was 14!  
     ( ..even though I probably got them through P2P // torrents.. :) )
