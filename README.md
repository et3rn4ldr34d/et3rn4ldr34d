### (Hello World!)

Welcome to my Security-focused GitHub.  You should find a few examples of my work, as well as some useful common scripts.

I'm currently focused on understanding blue-team focused skills, as well as practicing basic web application bug hunting.

My goal is to understand the most common attack vectors and how to defend against them, as well as researching novel attack vectors.
